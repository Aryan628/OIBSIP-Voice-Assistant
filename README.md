# Voice-Controlled Assistant

A simple voice-controlled assistant written in Python using SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3, pywhatkit, datetime, and wikipedia. This assistant allows users to perform various tasks through voice commands, such as playing music on YouTube, checking the current time and date, asking about someone or something, and engaging in casual conversation.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition:** Uses the SpeechRecognition library to capture user voice input.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Employs pyttsx3 to convert text responses into speech.
- **Command Processing:** Recognizes and executes commands based on user instructions.
- **Functionality:**
  - Play music on YouTube with `play` or `sing` commands.
  - Retrieve the current time and date.
  - Respond to casual queries like "How are you?" or "What's your name?"
  - Search and provide information from Wikipedia about people or topics.
  - Greet users with random salutations.
